# sortmerge
Fairly impressive university assignment implementing a sortmerge join algorithm in C.
 
Out of all the assignments I did this one was by far the most challenging and enjoyable.
 
I think my implementation was pretty good so I thought I'd put it up here for people to take a look at.
 
Keep in mind I had to do things the way my course wanted them done, so there's probably things that could be done better.
